## johnrostron.github.io

This is a test repository to learn a bit about setting up webpages with GitHub Pages. 

The website associated with this repository is at: https://johnrostron.github.io

The master branch will contain things to be used in the website (e.g. jupyter notebooks). 

A separate branch (gh-pages) will be used to hold files for creating the website itself (e.g. markdown files, website theme config files).


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/johnrostron/johnrostron.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file (see gh-pages branch).
